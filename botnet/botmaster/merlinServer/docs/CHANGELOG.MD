## 0.1.0 - 2017-06-10

This release marks a stable BETA version of Merlin. Both the server and
the agent cross-compile to Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The 64 bit version
 of the agent binaries for all 3 platform can be found in data\bin. The
32 bit binaries are not provided, but could be compiled if you desire.
Check the README in the data\bin directory. To run this release,
download Merlin_v0.1Beta.zip and unzip the contents. Next, download the
applicable binary for your platform (i.e. merlinserver_windows_x64.exe)
and place it in the root of that unzipped folder. The binary can be run
from the command line. Alternatively, Merlin can be run directly as a go
 script with go run cmd\merlinserver.go.
